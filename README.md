# Flowing Vision

## project background
Flowing Vision is a HackMTY (hackathon) project, the goal was addressing the water crisis in Monterrey. Me and my team built an AI leak detection model that uses computer vision to identify water leaks in industrial pipelines through security camera feeds. The model was made entirely from scratch, i even helped with the data classification and data labeling.

## current status: massive refactor
I'm currently re-making this project from the ground up myself. The key change is that I've decided to rebuild the application using Django instead of NextJS. I chose Django because ive used it before but just once so i wanna keep learning more about it (also all the winners of this hackathon used django for some reason).

## Goals
1. Learning Django entirely through tutorials and forums
2. Taking a break from AI
3. Building everything myself to improve my understanding
4. Documenting my learning process through hackclub along the way

## why choosing this project?
This was one of the most fun projects to made and also one of my best hackathon expierences, i thnk this project can look really good in my resume and my goal is to get it up and running, my way, solo. This is also going to help me improve in django and who knows maybe some people will like the repo, i think its something not conventional

This repository now serves as both a project and a personal manifesto for how I want to approach learning in this season.

More updates coming as my coding progresses!
